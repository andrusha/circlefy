							<p class="callout">Hey, we're developers too, and we know just how exciting it is to integrate new technologies!</p>
							<p>That's why we're planning to launch an API for Tap in the near future, so that other developers could also join in on the fun, and change the way we communicate.</p>
							<p>Right now our focus is getting the basics up and running so we'll all be sure that everyone's apps run just fine. But eventually, we'll open Tap to third-party developers via an API so that you'll be able to make your own apps that could integrate with our application.</p>
							<p>If you're interested in developing for or integrating Tap, then don't hesitate to drop us a message!</p>
